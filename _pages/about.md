Hi!✌️ My name is Ha, and you can call me River!😁 I've just completed my bachelor degree at USTH, and my major is Information and Communication Technology (ICT). During the training time at USTH, I found myself have passion for the AI/ML field, thus I did more projects in this domain. I can use fluently Python programming language and its libraries/frameworks for Machine Learning.

Moreover, I'm so interested in reading books and playing piano. Therefore, I create this portfolio site not only for introducing my profile, but also for sharing my hobbies! Hope that people will enjoy my site!😁😎

P/S: My blog posts will be writted in Vietnamese (may be in English soon).
